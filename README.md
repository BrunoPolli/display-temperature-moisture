# Project Temperature/Moisture ðŸŒ¡ðŸ’§

This is a project developed in NodeMCU ESP8266 v12-e and TFT display 240x240.

## Temperature display
The value is updated by requests in NodeMCU route '/update' by python scheduler:
https://github.com/BrunoPolli/temperature-moisture-scheduler

## Moisture value
A moisture sensor is responsible for reading analog values between 0-1023, that will be converted into a percentage format in code.  

## Icons
The icons and sprites for animation shown in display are created by me, using pixel editor PISKEL APP:
